# interviewQs
My answers to some coding interview questions.

I am really interested in computer science and plan on pursuing it in college. In order to apply my existing knowledge and learn new topics,
I have started answering some common interview questions which are seen at large software companies. Any advice on further optimization
would be greatly appreciated.
